Quake2World BETA - http://quake2world.net

Thank you for downloading Quake2World BETA for Linux. In order to run the game,
you must first run ./bin/q2wupdate. This will retrieve game data and updated 
binaries from the official Quake2World release server.

The first time you run ./bin/q2wupdate, it may take several minutes. However,
on subsequent runs, it should be significantly faster, as only new or changed
content will be downloaded.

You should run ./bin/q2wupdate regularly, as the game is constantly being added
to and improved.

Once ./bin/q2wupdate completes, you may run ./bin/quake2world. You can also
make a custom application launcher for Quake2World to place it in your Desktop
menus. An icon is provided in this folder.
