TODO for devenv 3.4:

 - clean up script directories
 - re-evaluate pdcurses situation
	- test http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm
 - maybe .... try to get netradiant compiling (ouch)
 - have some way to automatically check for new packages upstream (fedora has something like that, check their wiki)
 - add svn and maybe git (mingw-get ???)
 - use a package manager ??? (gpack, needs some fixes tho)
 - do proper dependencie handling, not just building packages in order
 - rename devenv ? GDE ??? anyone ?
 - test experimental gcc 4.8
 - test LLVM/clang
