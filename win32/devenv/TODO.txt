TODO for devenv 3.3:

 - clean up script directories
 - clean up devenv3.bat some more
 - re-evaluate pdcurses situation
	- test http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm
 - maybe .... try to get netradiant compiling (ouch)
 - have some way to automatically check for new packages upstream
 - add svn and maybe git (mingw-get ???)
