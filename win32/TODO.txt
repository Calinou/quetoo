TODO for devenv 3.1:

 - clean up script directories
 - clean up devenv3.bat some more
 - re-evaluate pdcurses situation
	- test http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm
 - maybe .... try to get netradiant compiling (ouch)
 - use some versions.txt to make changing versions in sh script obsolete
	- include versions.txt in devenv package
